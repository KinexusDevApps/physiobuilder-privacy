Privacy Policy for PhysioBuilder
Effective Date: September 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Kinexus Dev ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in the PhysioBuilder mobile application (the "App").

1. The Core of Our Privacy: Your Data is Yours
PhysioBuilder is designed with your privacy as a top priority. All data you enter into the app is stored exclusively on your local device. We do not have servers, we do not collect, see, share, or have any access to your patient information, exercise programs, or any other content you create.

2. Information You Provide
While using the App, you may choose to enter and save the following information on your device:

Therapist and Clinic Information: Your name and your clinic's name.

Patient Information: Your patients' names, contact details, and clinical notes.

Exercise Programs: Custom exercise routines you build.

User-Uploaded Images: Images from your device's gallery or camera that you add to the exercise library.

This information is managed by you and remains on your device.

3. How We Use Information
The information you enter is used solely for the functionality of the App, allowing you to:

Create and manage patient profiles.

Build, save, and assign exercise programs.

Generate PDF documents of exercise programs.

Customize the look and feel of the App and its exports.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share your data with anyone.

The App includes features that allow you to share information under your own control:

Share PDF: This feature allows you to send a generated PDF to other applications on your device (e.g., email, messaging apps). This action is initiated by you, and the data is not sent to us.

Export Data: This feature allows you to create a local backup file of your app data. This file is saved to your device, and you are responsible for its security.

5. Data Security
The security of your data is directly tied to the security of your mobile device. We recommend you use your device's security features, such as a screen lock, PIN, or biometric authentication, to protect all the information stored on it, including the data within PhysioBuilder.

6. Children's Privacy
The App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App's "About" section.
